I felt a sense of pride participating in this panel, where we discussed [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) and strategies for contributing to this outstanding project.
It was an excellent discussion on how to get started with Quarkus whether you are a seasoned developer or a novice just starting out in the open source community.
Quarkus is a Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot and GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards.
