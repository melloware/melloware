Following several years of maintaining a WordPress website solely dedicated to marketing my software, I resolved to overhaul the website's design.
Over the course of several years, I marketed software for both PC and mobile platforms, specializing in addressing industry gaps,
particularly within the realm of Home Automation. However, as time has passed, major corporations like Samsung, Google, Amazon,
and others have ventured into this domain, leaving little room for smaller independent players, including myself.
Consequently, my sales gradually declined.

I've intentionally chosen to prioritize my open-source endeavors and write about topics that I'm actively engaged with or deeply passionate about.
Although I can't predict the frequency of my future blogging, I've created this platform as an available option whenever I feel the need to use it.

As I delved into the website redesign process, selecting the appropriate technology became a crucial consideration.
Eventually, I opted for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for a multitude of reasons, primarily influenced by its favorable feedback and the fact that it relies entirely
on Reactâ€”a UI technology that forms an integral part of my daily work. I was deciding between Gastby, Jekyll, and Hugo.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in Go. Hugo takes data files, i18n bundles, configuration, templates for layouts, static files, and content written in Markdown and renders a static website. It is an open source project licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

The ultimate determinant was the thorough comparison conducted by the Gatsby team, which pitted [Gatsby, Jekyll, and Hugo](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/features/jamstack/gatsby-vs-jekyll-vs-hugo) against each other. While opinions may vary, I can confidently say that I haven't been let down by my choice.
