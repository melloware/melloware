PrimeFaces 15.0.10 introduces a significant enhancement to the `SelectOneButton` and `SelectManyButton` components: support for custom behaviors via the `p:ajax` tag. This new feature enables developers to attach AJAX behaviors to these components, providing greater flexibility and interactivity within applications.

## What Are Custom Behaviors?

Custom behaviors allow you to define client-side scripts and server-side listeners that execute in response to specific component events. With the addition of `p:ajax` support, `SelectOneButton` and `SelectManyButton` can now participate in AJAX-based interactions, enabling dynamic updates without full-page refreshes.

## SelectOneButton with Custom Behaviors

The `SelectOneButton` component now supports the `change` event, which is triggered when the user selects a different option. Here's an example of how to use this feature:

```xml
<p:selectOneButton value="#{bean.selectedOption}">
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 1" itemValue="1" />
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 2" itemValue="2" />
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 3" itemValue="3" />
    <p:ajax event="change" listener="#{bean.handleChange}" update="outputPanel" />
</p:selectOneButton>

<h:panelGroup id="outputPanel">
    <h:outputText value="Selected Option: #{bean.selectedOption}" />
</h:panelGroup>
```

In this example, when the user selects a different option, the `handleChange` method in the backing bean is invoked, and the `outputPanel` is updated to reflect the selected option.

## SelectManyButton with Custom Behaviors

Similarly, `SelectManyButton` also supports the `change` event for handling multiple selections:

```xml
<p:selectManyButton value="#{bean.selectedOptions}">
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 1" itemValue="1" />
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 2" itemValue="2" />
    <f:selectItem itemLabel="Option 3" itemValue="3" />
    <p:ajax event="change" listener="#{bean.handleChange}" update="outputPanel" />
</p:selectManyButton>

<h:panelGroup id="outputPanel">
    <h:outputText value="Selected Options: #{bean.selectedOptions}" />
</h:panelGroup>
```

## Backing Bean Example

Here's a simple backing bean implementation to handle the change event:

```java
@Named
@ViewScoped
public class ButtonBean implements Serializable {
    private String selectedOption;
    private List<String> selectedOptions;

    public void handleChange(AjaxBehaviorEvent event) {
        // Handle the change event
        // You can access the component and perform any necessary logic
    }

    // Getters and setters
    public String getSelectedOption() {
        return selectedOption;
    }

    public void setSelectedOption(String selectedOption) {
        this.selectedOption = selectedOption;
    }

    public List<String> getSelectedOptions() {
        return selectedOptions;
    }

    public void setSelectedOptions(List<String> selectedOptions) {
        this.selectedOptions = selectedOptions;
    }
}
```

## Benefits

The addition of custom behaviors to `SelectOneButton` and `SelectManyButton` provides several advantages:

- **Enhanced User Experience**: Immediate feedback and dynamic updates without full-page reloads improve the responsiveness of your application.
- **Improved Performance**: By processing only necessary components via AJAX, you can reduce server load and improve overall application performance.
- **Greater Flexibility**: The ability to define complex client-side interactions tailored to your application's specific needs.
- **Simplified Development**: Handle events directly within the component, reducing the need for additional JavaScript code and leading to cleaner, more maintainable codebases.
- **Badge Support**: Adding badges to buttons, a frequently requested feature, is now possible through custom rendering.

## Available Events

Currently, both components support the following event:

- **change**: Triggered when the selection changes (for `SelectOneButton`) or when selections are modified (for `SelectManyButton`).

## Conclusion

The custom behaviors feature in PrimeFaces 15.0.10 makes `SelectOneButton` and `SelectManyButton` more powerful and flexible components. By leveraging the `p:ajax` tag, developers can create more interactive and responsive user interfaces with minimal effort.
