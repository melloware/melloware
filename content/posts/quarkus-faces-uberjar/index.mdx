An Uber-JAR, also known as a fat JAR or JAR with dependencies, is a Java Archive (JAR) file that contains a Java program and its dependencies. This means that the Uber-JAR functions as a single distribution of the software, without requiring any additional Java code. 
Here are some advantages of Uber-JARs:
* **Portability**: Uber-JARs are portable. 
* **Ease of execution**: Uber-JARs are easy to execute in IDEs. 
* **All-in-one**: Uber-JARs are all-in-one distributions of software. 

Quarkus offers the ability to build Uber-JARs by adding `quarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar` to your `application.properties` file.

QuarkusFaces users have been unable to build Uber-JARs due to MyFaces' lack of support for the `quarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar` property. 
In 2022, a MyFaces ticket was opened to address this limitation: [MYFACES-4427](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-4427). 
This has been a significant pain point for users looking to distribute their Faces applications as a single file.


## The Issue

The main challenge is that Java EE applications can include multiple `web-fragment.xml` and `faces-config.xml` files, while an Uber-JAR only supports one of each. 
To build a functional Uber-JAR, these files must be merged into a single, unified configuration. Additionally, all ServiceLoader resources, also known as SPI files, 
must be merged as well. Examples of SPI files include `service/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` and `services/jakarta.el.ExpressionFactory`.


## The Solution

Apache MyFaces 4.1.0-RC3 has [added support](https://github.com/apache/myfaces/blob/main/extensions/quarkus/deployment/src/main/java/org/apache/myfaces/core/extensions/quarkus/deployment/FacesUberJarProcessor.java) to merge all of the above files properly so the final Uber-JAR will have the correct configuration.
Now you can build and run your Faces application as an Uber-JAR with the following command:

```bash
mvn clean package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
java -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
```
