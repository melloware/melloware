Over the course of several years, I marketed software for both PC and mobile platforms, specializing in addressing industry gaps, particularly within the realm of Home Automation. However, as time has passed, major corporations like Samsung, Google, Amazon, and others have ventured into this domain, leaving little room for smaller independent players, including myself. Consequently, my sales gradually declined.
I'd like to express my gratitude to all those who supported my software in the past. Today, I am making it available for FREE download!
