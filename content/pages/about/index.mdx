Melloware was started in 1999 as a place to put our applications that we found filled a need that was missing in the marketplace. We think it is both creative and useful software that someone else should have written, but did not!

### Our Motto

_"The most successful method of programming is to begin a program as simply as possible, test it, and then add to the program until it performs the required job."_ â€“ PDP8 handbook, Pg9-64
